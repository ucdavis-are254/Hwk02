# Getting started

- Download and install Julia

- Fork and clone this `Hwk01` repository to your computer

- Open Julia and change directory to this repository

    ```julia
    ; cd C:\\Users\\magerton\\Downloads\\hwk01
    ```

- To install the appropriate libraries, activate the environment in the directory and instantiate it to install packages. See [docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.0/stdlib/Pkg/#Using-someone-else's-project-1)

    ```julia
    ] activate .
    ] instantiate
    ```

- Get a Jupyter notebook going (you'll need to click `y`)

    ```julia
    using IJulia
    jupyterlab()
    ```

- Do the homework

- Submit via github Classroom by issuing a pull request. You can submit as many times as you want before the homework is due
